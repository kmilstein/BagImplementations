# Bag Implementations

For my 2353 students,

Write a test for each method in the LinkedBag class. A LinkedBagDemo class is provided for you. As well as a testIsEmpty method as
an example. One of the LinkedBag's methods has a logic error in it. The tests you write will help you find it. Fix the error, then
move the next section.

The original LinkedBag was created using an inner class. I have provided you with the out of a Linked Bag using an external Node
class called LinkedBagImpl. Implement a LinkedBag using an external Node class, then test your LinkedBag. 

If you have already completed Project1, use it for the third part of this challenge. Otherwise, work on Project1. 

For part three, implement the methods the five methods that can used with classes that have implemented the comparable interface:
getMin, getMax, removeMin, removeMax, and getAllLessThan. Test this new bag using the Employee class from Project1.

Work on this in groups of two or three. 

Feel free to ask questions if you get stuck!

Good luck!
